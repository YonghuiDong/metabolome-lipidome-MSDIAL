# Secondary MS1 feature identification with HMDB

After processing our metabolomics LCMS data using the MS-DIAL pipeline, we can get secondary annotations for our MS1 data by matching the mass data to the [Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)](https://hmdb.ca/). Before this step, you should run your data through the GNPS MS/MS secondary annotation steps ([workflow here](https://github.com/respiratory-immunology-lab/metabolome-lipidome-MSDIAL/tree/main/gnps_processing)).

The HMDB database (version 4 - July 2021) has been formatted and filtered for features that are annotated or documented, and saved as a .RDS file ([available here](https://github.com/respiratory-immunology-lab/metabolome-lipidome-MSDIAL/blob/main/hmdb_processing/hmdb_detected_quantified_v4_20210701.rds)).

To facilitate the adding of these annotations to your `SummarizedExperiment` object, a function is available at the top of the page. Its usage will be explained here.

## Method

You should currently have a `SummarizedExperiment` object that has been pre-processed with [`pmp`](https://github.com/respiratory-immunology-lab/metabolome-lipidome-MSDIAL/tree/main/pmp_preprocessing), and then had the MS/MS data annotated with [GNPS](https://github.com/respiratory-immunology-lab/metabolome-lipidome-MSDIAL/tree/main/gnps_processing). The next stage is to match the MS1 mass data for each feature to the HMDB database file.

### Appending HMDB annotations to SummarizedExperiment objects

The first step is to load the formatted HMDB data.frame into your R session.

```R
# Load HMDB dataset
hmdb_df <- readRDS(here::here('hmdb', 'hmdb_detected_quantified_v4_20210701.rds'))

### OR

hmdb_df <- readRDS('/path/to/hmdb/dataframe/')
```

Then, using the `add_hmdb()` function available above, we can search the HMDB annotations in the data.frame and add them to our `SummarizedExperiment` objects, as shown below with an example stool metabolomics object.

If you are using the output of the `pmp_preprocess()` function, you should annotate both the `glog_results` and `imputed_results` list components for consistency in case you need to use the imputed values downstream instead of the glog-transformed data.

The function takes three parameters:

- `metab_SE`: the `SummarizedExperiment` object.
- `hmdb`: the formatted HMDB data.frame.
- `mass_tol`: the MS1 mass tolerance value (set to 0.002 Da by default).

```R
# Search annotations in HMDB and add to the SE objects
metab_stool_pmp$glog_results <- add_hmdb(metab_SE = metab_stool_pmp$glog_results,
                                         hmdb = hmdb_df, mass_tol = 0.002)
metab_stool_pmp$imputed_results <- add_hmdb(metab_SE = metab_stool_pmp$imputed_results,
                                            hmdb = hmdb_df, mass_tol = 0.002)
```

### Comparing annotations from MS-DIAL, GNPS, HMDB, and KEGG

We can now compare the assigned annotations from each of the methods using the function `compare_annotations()`, available in this folder.
It will produce a data.frame containing only features with at least one annotation, and allow us see whether the annotations typically agree with each other.

The function takes only a single argument: a `SummarizedExperiment` object that has undergone secondary annotation with both GNPS and HMDB.

```R
# Prepare data.frame with alignment IDs and all four annotations and filter for at least one annotation
msdial_gnps_hmdb_glog <- compare_annotations(metab_stool_pmp$glog_results)
```

A section of an example output with the stool metabolomics data looks like:

|          | Retention.time | MSDIAL_annotation                           | GNPS_annotation   | HMDB_annotation                          | KEGG_annotation      |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|   42_pos |         15.142 | NA                                          | NA                | 2-Pyrrolidinone                          | C11118               |
|   59_pos |         10.270 | NA                                          | NA                | Piperidine                               | C01746               |
|   60_pos |         10.758 | NA                                          | NA                | Piperidine                               | C01746               |
| 1325_pos |         15.050 | 5-Aminopentanoic acid; LC-ESI-QTOF; MS2; CE | 5-Aminopentanoate | L-Valine;5-Aminopentanoic acid;Norvaline | C00183;C00431;C01799 |

### Keeping only annotated features

From here, we can filter our `SummarizedExperiment` object for features with at least one annotation using the `keep_annotated()` function above.
It assigns rownames based on a naming hierarchy: HMDB > GNPS > MS-DIAL.
A new `rowData` element will also be added to the `SummarizedExperiment` object called `shortname`.

This function will be applied to only a single `SummarizedExperiment` object, and the output can be assigned to a new object that can be used for downstream analyses. In the example below, we will run the function for just the glog-transformed data, and assign it to a new object called `metab_stool_glog`.

The function takes only a single argument: a `SummarizedExperiment` object that has undergone secondary annotation with both GNPS and HMDB.

```R
# Keep only annotated rows and generate shortname column
metab_stool_glog <- keep_annotated(metab_stool_pmp$glog_results)
```

Aside from using `rownames()`, we can also retrieve the resulting "preferred" annotation names for our features as follows:

```R
# Retrieve the shortname values
metab_shortnames <- rowData(metab_stool_glog)$shortname
```
